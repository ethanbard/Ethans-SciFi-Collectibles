# Ethans-SciFi-Collectibles
This was my final project for an ASP.NET class. 
It is a fictional online store selling various sci-fi merchandise (like a Doctor Who action figure set or Star Trek PEZ dispensers).
It is written in C# ASP.NET.

This program uses a Microsoft Access database, so you will need to have Access installed for it to work.
To run the program, clone the repository and import it into Microsoft Visual Studio.
From there, click the "run" button.
